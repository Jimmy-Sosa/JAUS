Just Another Useful Script  <br />
This Repository is my first, and I am just learning how to write simple but useful scripts and such for the many projects I have going at home.  <br />
I am a beginner coder, therefor I look forward to learning as much as I can while doing things in a neat and tidy way.<br/>
Thank you to any help that you offer me as I learn how to configure my own LAMP server that I will be running on OpenBSD 6.6.  <br />
I am also brand new to BSD but have been extremely interested in things of this nature for a long time and now find myself with the time to pursue my interests.  <br />
Look forward to working with you all and enjoying my time learning and growing as a coder and sysop.  <br /><br />
